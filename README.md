# jmathstudio
JMathStudio is a pure Java based numerical computation toolkit for discrete Image and Signal processing. This toolkit provides a Java developer with many of the advanced and basic discrete image and signal processing capabilities. This is a stand alone toolkit with no dependencies other than the JDK/JRE 1.5 or higher.
JMathStudio is an exhaustive library of more than 500 defined functions, operations, transforms and utilities useful in discrete Image and Signal processing (over 40,000 lines of java code). Some of the important capabilities provided by this toolkit are:

- Define various 1D and 2D real and complex data structures and many of the useful manipulations over the same.
- Define various iterators to iterate over the elements of data structures.
- Support interface to load and write an external image with different image formats (like PNG, JPEG, TIFF etc) to/from different   PixelImages (which is JMathStudio standard image type) or Java Buffered Image.
- Provides easy interface to display different kind of images and to plot a signal.
- On image processing side this toolkit supports numerous operations, transforms and algorithms ranging from,
  - Image Clustering
  - Image denoising
